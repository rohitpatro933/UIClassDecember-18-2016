what are sematic elements ?
HTML serves both humans and machines, suggesting the purpose of the content enclosed within an HTML tag.
Some of the tags they used were actually semantic. Their roles are clear for both us and the user agent: <form> simply contains a form, just like <img> contains an image. 



difference between article, section, div
Ans- The <article> tag specifies independent, self-contained content. An article should make sense on its own and it should be possible to distribute it independently from the rest of the site. The article defines about the header title.

The <section> tag defines sections in a document, such as chapters, headers, footers, or any other sections of the document. This tag is used when you need to separate a section or chapter in a document. You can even set a hyperlink to the section so that we can navigate directly to the selected section.
The <div> tag is used to divide your html code into different sets which helps to make the code better. Using the <div> tag user can organize the code in a simple way and can even add style tag to the code or edit the code easily.

what are forms and what is form validation in html?
Ans- HTML Forms are one of the main points of interaction between a user and a web site or application. They allow users to send data to the web site. Most of the time that data is sent to the web server, but the web page can also intercept it to use it on its own.
The ability to validate most user data without relying on scripts is known as data validation. All  <input> elements can be validated using the attributes. If an element requires a value before the submission of the form, you can mark the element using the required attribute. When this attribute is true, the field is not allowed to be empty.

Ans- 
	The simpler doctype declaration is just one of the many novelties in HTML5. Now you need to write only: <!doctype html>
	The syntax of HTML5 is more compatible when compared with HTML4.
	HTML5, <header> and <footer> are unnecessary to be identified with a <div> tag.
	HTML5 has adopted <section> and <article> tags which allows you to mark specific areas of your layouts.
	The audio and video files can be added easily. There are also some new multimedia elements and attributes, such as <track>, that provides text tracks for the video element.
