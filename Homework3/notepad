How to resolve merge conflicts?
Ans- 1. Open git.
2. Navigate into the local git repository that has the merge conflict. 
3. Generate a list of the files affected by the merge conflict. Open your text editor and navigate to the file that has merge conflicts.
4. To see the beginning of the merge conflict in your file, search the file for the conflict marker <<<<<<<. When you open the file in your text editor, you'll see the changes from the head or base branch after the line <<<<<<< head. Next, you'll see =======, which divides your changes from the changes in the other branch, followed by >>>>>>> branch-name. 
5. Decide if you want to keep only your branch's changes, keep only the other branch's changes, or make a brand new change, which may incorporate changes from both branches. Delete the conflict markers <<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>> and make the changes you want in the final merge. 
6. Add or stage your changes.
7. Commit your changes with a comment.
