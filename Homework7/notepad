Homework 7

1) what is the differences between id, class, attribute, tagName selectors and differences between them, when to use what?
Ans- 
id Selector
The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element.
The id of an element should be unique within a page, so the id selector is used to select one unique element.
To select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, followed by the id of the element.
example-
#paragraph1 {
    text-align: center;
    color: red;
}

class Selector
The class selector selects elements with a specific class attribute.
To select elements with a specific class, write a period (.) character, followed by the name of the class.
example
.center {
    text-align: center;
    color: red;
}

attribute Selector
The attribute selector is used to select elements with a specified attribute.
This allows you to target elements for styling according to the elements attribute and attribute values.
example
a[target] {
    background-color: yellow;
}



2) what is css Specificity? --> explain with all possible examples(of all variations)?
Ans- Specificity is the means by which browsers decide which CSS property values are the most relevant to an element and, therefore, will be applied. Specificity is based on the matching rules which are composed of different sorts of CSS selectors.
Specificity is a  CSS declaration, determined by the number of each selector type in the matching selector. When specificity is equal to any of the multiple declarations, the last declaration found in the CSS is applied to the element. Specificity only applies when the same element is targeted by multiple declarations. As per CSS rules, directly targeted element will always take precedence over rules which an element inherits from its ancestor.
attribute based styles-

CSS [attribute="value"] Selector
The [attribute="value"] selector is used to select elements with a specified attribute and value.
a[target="_blank"] { 
    background-color: yellow;
}

CSS [attribute~="value"] Selector
The [attribute~="value"] selector is used to select elements with an attribute value containing a specified word.
[title~="rainbow"] {
    border: 5px solid yellow;
}

CSS [attribute|="value"] Selector
The [attribute|="value"] selector is used to select elements with the specified attribute starting with the specified value.
[class|="top"] {
    background: yellow;
}

CSS [attribute^="value"] Selector
The [attribute^="value"] selector is used to select elements whose attribute value begins with a specified value.
<style>
[class^="top"] {
    background: yellow;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h1 class="top-header">Welcome</h1>
<p class="top-text">Hello world!</p>
<p class="topcontent">Are you learning CSS?</p>

</body>

CSS [attribute$="value"] Selector
The [attribute$="value"] selector is used to select elements whose attribute value ends with a specified value.
<html>
<head>
<style> 
[class$="test"] {
    background: yellow;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<div class="first_test">The first div element.</div>
<div class="second">The second div element.</div>
<div class="my-test">The third div element.</div>
<p class="mytest">This is some text in a paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>


CSS [attribute*="value"] Selector
The [attribute*="value"] selector is used to select elements whose attribute value contains a specified value.
<html>
<head>
<style> 
[class*="te"] {
    background: yellow;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<div class="first_test">The first div element.</div>
<div class="second">The second div element.</div>
<div class="my-test">The third div element.</div>
<p class="mytest">This is some text in a paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>



5) descendent selectors in css?
Ans- The descendant selectors — typically represented by a single space ( ) character — combines two selectors such that elements matched by the second selector are selected if they have an ancestor element matching the first selector. Selectors that utilize a descendant combinator are called descendant selectors.
The descendant combinator is technically one or more CSS white space characters — the space character and/or one of four control characters: carriage return, form feed, new line, and tab characters — between two selectors in the absence of another combinator. Additionally, the white space characters of which the combinator is comprised may contain any number of CSS comments.
li {
  list-style-type: disc;
}

li li {
  list-style-type: circle;
}



6) child selector in css?
Ans- The > combinator separates two selectors and matches only those elements matched by the second selector that are direct children of elements matched by the first. By contrast, when two selectors are combined with the descendant selector, the combined selector expression matches those elements matched by the second selector for which there exists an ancestor element matched by the first selector, regardless of the number of "hops" up the DOM. example-
span { background-color: white; }
div > span {
  background-color: DodgerBlue;
}
<div>
  <span>Span #1, in the div.
    <span>Span #2, in the span that's in the div.</span>
  </span>
</div>
<span>Span #3, not in the div at all.</span>



7) adjacent sibiling selectors in css?
Ans- This is referred to as an adjacent selector or next-sibling selector. It will select only the specified element that immediately follows the former specified element. Example- 
li:first-of-type + li {
  color: red;
}
<ul>
  <li>One</li>
  <li>Two</li>
  <li>Three</li>
</ul>



8) multiple selectors in css? using , comma
Ans- element,element Selector
Select and style all <h1> elements AND all <p> elements
Example- 
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
h1, p {
    background-color: yellow;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h1>Hi everyone</h1>

<div>
  <p>My name is Rohit.</p>
  <p>I live in fremont.</p>
</div>

<p>I like to play football.</p>

</html>
